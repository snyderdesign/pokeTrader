# pokeTrader

Gather-up your pokeballs and start tossing!  This is the start of a pokemon trading iOS app that allows players to capture and sell pokemon for profit.

It's in its infantsy and only works in the latest stable build of xCode (does not work in the current 3-beta)

This is a basic iOS app built in Swift.  IT primarially uses tables.  This app does NOT use spriteKit.
